      <h3>Hello! Welcome to our site, which will provide you with detailed insight
        into staying healthy and reaching your fitness goals. Developed by Yash Gupta
        and Karthik Sundar, the site, and its key feature, a chatbot, will help you
        apprehend the steps that you need to take in order to reach your goal. By taking
        in key information, which includes your height, weight, fitness goal, injuries,
        and allergies, our advanced chatbot will compute and return a fairly detailed
        diet and fitness plan catered for your goals. The central ideology with our research,
        and hence our chatbot, is that any body goal can be attained by tackling two elements:
        nutrition and exercise. This is precisely what our chatbot factors in. We hope you are able
        to find your perfect lifestyle.</h3>
